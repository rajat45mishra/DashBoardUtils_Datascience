What is a Job Offer Letter?

When the employer finds the right candidate, he contacts them with a job offer. Mostly the HR department calls the chosen candidate and lets them know about the job offer. The job offer is also sent to the candidate via email or in writing. Job offer letter may not always be an employment agreement, an offer letter:

    Offers a position to the selected candidate
    Includes the main terms and conditions of the job offer
    Provide details about the position and company to help the candidate to accept the job offer.

If the candidate finds the job offer letter to be acceptable, they will sign and return the letter to the employer. The job offer letter is not legally binding like an employee agreement. This offers legal protection to the employers and the employees before signing the employment agreement. However, the employer can revoke the job offer letter under section 5 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 before receiving the communication of acceptance.
